# How to build?
Requires Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0

After installed search for x86 Free Build Environment. Open it

Go to the source code of NativeLinux and type the following command:

`build /g /W` or let a batch do this for you by typing just `b`.

> [!NOTE]
> Some files had to be modified due to many compilation errors that includes mini-rv32ima.h
> <br /> Including disabling some warnings
> <br /> An portable stdint.h had to be added due of not being included in WDK 7. Resulting in many compilation errors
> <br /> The keyboard is US Layout only.

# Installation
Copy nativelinux.exe to %SystemRoot%\System32 (C:\Windows\System32\)

Open the install.reg from the `files` directory.

From a release build just open the install.cmd which will do everything for you, Requires Admin privileges (UAC)

# Limited features
Backspace has been disabled. Due to it being broken

No ANSI sequences due of it being unsupported in Native mode.

# To do
  - [ ] Get keyboard to work on Windows 2000
  - [ ] Get backspace to work
  - [ ] Fix more crashes during some commands on NativeLinux
  - [ ] Fix ctrl outputting âŒƒ@ sometimes when pressed
  - [X] ~~Maybe make the exit command redirect to the Windows GUI.~~ (Implemented as a Shift + ESC shortcut)
