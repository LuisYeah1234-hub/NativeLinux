# How to Build NativeLinux?
Requires Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0

After Installing. Search for x86 Free Build Enviroment. Open it.

Go to the Source Code of NativeLinux and Type the following Command: `build /g /W` or let a batch do this for you by just typing `b`.

> [!NOTE]
> Some files had to be changed due to multiple compilation errors, including mini-rv32ima.h; disable some warnings.
> <br />Portable stdint.h was added because it was not included in WDK 7, which resulted in many compilation errors.
> <br />The keyboard has only an English-US layout.



# Installation

1. Copy nativelinux.exe to the %SystemRoot%\System32 (C:\Windows\System32) folder.
2. Open the install.reg from the `Files` Directory.

From a Release Build: Just unzip downloaded archive open the install.cmd **AS ADMIN** which will do everything for you.



# Manual Uninstallation in case of not working keyboard
